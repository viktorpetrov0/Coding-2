# Coding-2 - Week 4

vertex - graph points
edge - connection between nodes/vertexes


A walk - going through nodes to get from one to another
Simple Graph - 
Multigraphs - any pairs of nodes can have as many edges connecting them
Complete Graph - Every single is connected to every other note in the graph (One vertex counts as a complete graph too)
Subgraph - If you take a subset of an existing graph to make another graph (vertex and edges will also be a subset of the existing graph) 

How we represent graphs in code:
Adjacency list - a: b,c
Adjacency matrix - a table (rows and collumns show nodes letters), marked with 0s and 1s depending if there is connection or not
Incidence matrix - a table similar to the adjency matrix except the collumns row is edges

Directed graph/Digraph - edges have directions
Simple directed graph - a single directed edge to another node
Multi directed graph - multiple directed edges connecting two nodes

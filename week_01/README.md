## Week 1 Task

Experiment with the code in `examples/gradient`

1. Imagine you're desingning branding for a computational art gallery.
- Find a colour palette of 3-5 colours. It can be taken from a photo, colour palette app, or from your Block 1 sketch from the class on Colour Interactions.
- Create a gradient that would work well with the colour palette that could be used as a background for posters, website animation, etc.
- Try slightly tweaking the colours.
- Can you change it’s direction?
- Can you make a circular gradient centred on the middle of the screen?

For the portfolio, submit at least 5 gradient variations. Include notes about your design and learning process, and how you'd develop it further.
